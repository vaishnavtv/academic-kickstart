abstract: " In this paper, a polynomial chaos based framework for designing controllers for discrete time linear systems with probabilistic parameters is presented. Conditions for exponential-mean-square stability for such systems are derived and algorithms for synthesizing optimal quadratically stabilizing controllers are proposed in a convex optimization formulation. The solution presented is demonstrated on the derived discrete-time models of a nonlinear F-16 aircraft model trimmed at a set of chosen points."
