abstract: "This paper presents a Lagrangian approach to simulating multibody dynamics in a tensegrity frame- work with an ability to tackle holonomic constraint violations in an energy-preserving scheme. Governing equations are described using non-minimum coordinates to simplify descriptions of the structureâ€™s kinematics. To minimize constraint drift arising from this redundant system, the direct correction method has been employed in conjunction with a novel energy-correcting scheme that treats the total mechanical energy of the system as a supplementary constraint. The formulation has been extended to allow tensegrity structures with compressible bars, allowing for further discussion on potential choices for softer bar materials. The benchmark example involving a common tensegrity structure demonstrates the superiority of the presented formulation over Simscape Multibody in terms of motion accuracy as well as energy conservation. The effectiveness of the energy correction scheme is found to be increasing with the extent of deformations in the structure."
