abstract: "Among   algorithms   used   for   sensor   fusion   for attitude  estimation  in  unmanned  aerial  vehicles,  the  Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is the most commonly used for estimation. In this paper, we propose a new version of H2 estimation called extended H2 estimation that can overcome the limitations of the extended  Kalman  Filter,  specifically  with  respect  to  computational speed, memory usage, and root mean squared error. We formulate a new attitude-estimation algorithm, where the filter gain  is  designed  offline  about  a  nominal  operating  point,  but the  filter  dynamics  is  implemented  using  the  nonlinear  system dynamics.  We  refer  to  this  implementation  of  the H2 optimal estimator as the extended H2 estimator. The solution presented is tested on two cases, corresponding to slow and rapid motions,and  compared  against  the  EKF  in  the  performance  metrics mentioned  above."
